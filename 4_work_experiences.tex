\begin{rSection}{Work Experience}

\begin{rSubsection}{ACT-I, Tokyo, Japan}{\em February 2020 - Present}{Research Assistant}{}
\item ACT-I is research programs supported by Japan Science and Technology (JST) to promote ICT area research. The acceptance rate of ACT-I is 25\%(=30/120).
\item Our research team, leaded by Ushiku Yoshitaka, aims to enable caption generation from various kinds of data. I mainly contribute to building a dataset for generating a recipe from an execution video.

\begin{rSubsection}{Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan}{\em April 2019 - Present}{Research Assistant}{}
\item Proposed a novel dataset ``r-FG-BB dataset'' which allows a model to ground visual objects with textual descriptions.
\item Submitted a paper to LREC2020 (accept).
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Pixiv, Inc, Fukuoka, Japan}{\em November 2017 - March 2019}{Machine Learning Engineer}{}
\item Developed a neural-network-based perceptual JPEG encoder, which can reduce the average size of images by 15\% without impacting the perceived visual quality of the images.
\item Available on Github: https://github.com/misogil0116/Biscotti
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Mercari, Inc, OH, USA}{\em November 2017 - November 2017}{Web Application Engineer}{}
\item ``Mercari'' is the app that allows users to sell and buy something used. I went to U.S to investigate how many people use the app and proposed a new solution to popularise the app.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Wantedly, Inc, Tokyo, Japan}{\em August 2017 - September 2017}{Machine Learning Engineer}{}
\item Developed named entity recognition (NER) system for the business card management app ``Wantedly People''. I improved F1 score by 10\% by replacing human-crafted machine learning systems with neural-network-based NER systems, such as ``biLSTM-CNN-CRF''.
