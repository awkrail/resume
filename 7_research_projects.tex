{\bf Procedural Text Generation} \\
Proposed a novel task to generate a procedural text from a photo sequence, and also proposed a method to generate a procedural text by incorporating a multi-modal embedding model into a text generation model, such as seq2seq.

{\bf Visual Grounding}\\
Proposed a novel dataset ``r-FG-BB dataset'' which allows a model to align visual objects with textual descriptions via a recipe flow graph, and showed the effectiveness of the dataset for grounding vision with text.

{\bf Unsupervised Alignment of Instructions with Video Segments}\\
Proposed a novel method to align textual instructions with video segments using the score which consists of cosine similarity and Euclidean difference, and showed an improvement of alignment systems compared to the conventional alignment systems.
