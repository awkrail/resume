{\bf Multimodal Learning of Instructional Videos (Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing)}
\\
I have focused on procedural text generation from instructional images/videos on various domains (e.g., cooking and biochemical videos). \\
- Recipe generation from unsegmented cooking videos [Nishimura+ Arxiv22] \\
- Structure-aware procedural text generation from an image sequence [Nishimura+ IEEE Access21] \\
- State-aware video procedure captioning [Nishimura+ ACMMM21] \\
- Applications for the biochemical domain [Nishimura+ ICCVW21]
