\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Shutoh}: A fast scene detector implemented in C++20. Inspired by PySceneDetect, Shutoh aims to provide a powerful and flexible alternative with enhanced performance. Shutoh achieves 2x~4x faster than PySceneDetect and supports not only rule-based (PySceneDetect), but also ML-based and neural-based scene detectors.
    \item \textbf{line/lighthouse}: A user-friendly and reproducible library for video moment retrieval and highlight detection. It supports six MR-HD models, three features, and five datasets for reproducible MR-HD. In addition, we prepare an inference-only API and Gradio demo for developers to use state-of-the-art VMR-HD approaches easily. I am a maintainer of this library and the URL is: \url{https://github.com/line/lighthouse}. This work was accepted at EMNLP 2024 demo.
