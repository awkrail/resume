\begin{rSection}{Introduction}
I am passionate about applying cutting-edge video technologies to consumer products, with a particular focus on video and language.
During my Ph.D. at Kyoto University, I developed algorithms for generating text from videos. At LY Corporation, I have been working on developing video-audio moment retrieval library [Nishimura+ EMNLP24, Munakata+ ICASSP25]. Then I joined Sony Interactive Entertainment (PlayStation) as senior machine learning engineer.
